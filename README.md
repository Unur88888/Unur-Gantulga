# Personal statement 
Currently Iâ€™m a MBA graduate student at Tunghai University. I pursued my bachelor degree in 2023 at Providence University, Taiwan 
During my four years of study in International Business Administration, I have maintained an excellent academic record and averaged 85%. As a result of my exposure to foreign national students from other countries during my four years at Providence, I have learned to engage more actively with the world. I am able to adapt, exceed and achieve great heights and expectations with my international business administration degree, as well as use my weaknesses and fears as a driving force for achieving tasks and challenges.
